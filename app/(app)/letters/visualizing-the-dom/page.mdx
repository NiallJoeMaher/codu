# Visualizing the DOM

This past week, I've been working on the free Codú JavaScript course. As part of the series, I wanted to provide a tool for visually representing the DOM tree.

So after a few hours I created something very simple that I think will help folks get a better mental model of the DOM.

You can [try it out here](https://www.codu.co/articles/visualizing-the-dom-a-new-tool-for-javascript-learners-wgr9t379).

The whole app is just a single file, so if you want to suggest improvements, play with the code or just look under the hood check out the codebase [here](https://github.com/codu-code/dom-visualizer).

## We are on Daily.dev

Talk about being late to the party...

I've used Daily.dev on and off for years, but I never thought of creating a Codú squad.

Well, now we have one!

You can join us using [this invite link](https://dly.to/UqNSyYCKM8A).

## JS Course Progress

I've started and made a major dent in my JavaScript series over the last week. Here is the series in order so far:

1.  **[Introduction to JavaScript](https://www.codu.co/articles/introduction-to-javascript-spgkt9nl)**
2.  **[Document Object Model (DOM)](https://www.codu.co/articles/document-object-model-dom-9fkccorq)**
3.  **[Primitive Data Types](https://www.codu.co/articles/primitive-data-types-50ko7qbp)**
4.  **[JavaScript Operators](https://www.codu.co/articles/javascript-operators-uxk7pnjq)**
5.  **[Expressions in JavaScript](https://www.codu.co/articles/expressions-in-javascript-qnwjihe_)**

I should have most of it complete by next week's issue, so don't forget to check back in!

## Something I've been enjoying

**[The Algebra of Wealth: A Simple Formula for Success](https://amzn.to/3W84Mh6)**

I recommend "The Algebra of Wealth" by Scott Galloway for this week's pick. It's a quick read that breaks down success into a simple formula. Galloway's no-nonsense style is perfect for busy devs like us who want practical advice without the fluff.

He covers topics like investing, career moves, and personal growth - all super relevant whether you're just starting out or looking to level up. I like how he mixes personal stories with solid tips you can actually use.

That's it for this week!
